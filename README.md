# Happiness Scores – Linear Mixed Models

This project applies **Linear Mixed Models (LMM)** to the **World Happiness Report** data (2015–2023), modeling both **fixed effects** (GDP, life expectancy, etc.) and **random effects** (country-specific trends and intercepts).

**This project is one of the first applications of Linear Mixed Models to World Happiness Report data, accounting for cross-country heterogeneity and temporal structure in longitudinal data.**
